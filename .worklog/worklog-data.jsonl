described in Acceptance criteria, use sample saves under regression/ if available.\n- Suggested steps:\n- Review referenced C++ files and map types/functions to Rust equivalents.\n- Implement minimal API in Rust crate and add serialization parity tests.\n- Run existing regression save files through parser and add failing cases as tests.","effort":"","id":"OM-0MKUZ2RY70E5D08V","issueType":"task","parentId":"OM-0MKV15X1I0VBYQA8","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":0,"stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Gameplay/commands

{"data":{"author":"@OpenCode","comment":"## Code Review: Windowing + SDL2 Implementation\n\nBased on inspection of the current implementation, here's my evaluation:\n\n### ✅ **What Works:**\n\n1. **Basic Structure**: The Rust implementation has been created with proper module structure (`rust/openttd_video/`)\n2. **Core Types**: Essential types are implemented:\n   - `VideoSubsystem` - manages SDL2 initialization\n   - `Window` - represents an SDL2 window\n   - `VideoMode`, `WindowMode`, `WindowOptions` - configuration types\n   - `VideoEvent` - event types (Quit, WindowResized, WindowFocusChanged)\n3. **SDL2 Integration**: The code correctly uses the `sdl2` crate with feature flags\n4. **Stub Support**: Provides a stub implementation when SDL2 is not available\n5. **Basic Functionality**:\n   - SDL2 initialization (`VideoSubsystem::init()`)\n   - Window creation with proper builder pattern\n   - Event polling with event mapping\n   - Window mode switching (windowed/fullscreen)\n   - Basic rendering (solid color fill)\n\n### ⚠️ **Partial Implementation / Issues:**\n\n1. **Acceptance Criteria AC1** (SDL2 init matches C++): **Partially Met**\n   - Basic SDL2 init is implemented\n   - Missing some C++ features like display resolution detection (`FindResolutions()`)\n   - No screensaver inhibition support\n   \n2. **Acceptance Criteria AC2** (Event loop behavior matches C++): **Partially Met**\n   - Basic event polling exists\n   - Missing full keyboard mapping (the C++ has extensive key mappings)\n   - No text input mode handling (EditBoxGainedFocus/EditBoxLostFocus)\n   - Missing mouse events and other window events\n\n3. **Acceptance Criteria AC3** (Window mode switching matches C++): **Partially Met** \n   - Basic fullscreen toggle implemented\n   - Missing resolution change support (`ChangeResolution`)\n   - No multi-monitor support\n\n4. **Testing Issues**:\n   - Unit tests crash with segfault when SDL2 feature is enabled (likely due to headless environment)\n   - CLI integration only works with stub mode currently\n\n### ❌ **Missing Features:**\n\n1. **Resolution Management**:\n   - No `FindResolutions()` equivalent\n   - No `GetAvailableVideoMode()` logic\n   - No display mode enumeration\n\n2. **Advanced Window Management**:\n   - No dirty rectangle tracking (`MakeDirty`)\n   - No palette animation support\n   - No video buffer locking/unlocking\n   - No blitter integration\n\n3. **Input Handling**:\n   - Incomplete keyboard mapping (missing full VK mapping table)\n   - No mouse cursor management\n   - No text input mode management\n\n4. **Rendering Backends**:\n   - No OpenGL backend support (sdl2_opengl_v.cpp)\n   - No software rendering backend (sdl2_default_v.cpp)\n\n### 🔧 **Recommendations:**\n\n1. The implementation provides a good foundation but needs significant work to match the C++ functionality\n2. Priority items to complete AC requirements:\n   - Add full keyboard event mapping\n   - Implement resolution detection and switching\n   - Add text input mode support\n   - Create integration tests that can run in CI (possibly with virtual display)\n3. The architecture is sound and follows Rust best practices with proper error handling and type safety\n\n**Overall Assessment**: The code **partially works** - it has the basic windowing scaffold in place and can create windows, handle basic events, and switch modes. However, it needs substantial additional work to fully satisfy all acceptance criteria and match the C++ implementation's functionality.\n\nFiles reviewed:\n- rust/openttd_video/src/lib.rs\n- rust/openttd_video/src/sdl2.rs\n- rust/openttd_cli/src/main.rs\n- src/video/sdl2_v.cpp\n- src/video/sdl2_v.h","createdAt":"2026-01-27T07:17:39.706Z","id":"OM-C0MKW9KRGA16SVH5Q","references":[],"workItemId":"OM-0MKUUWY0N11LUDT5"},"type":"comment"}

{"data":{"author":"@opencode","comment":"## Analysis of main_gui.cpp and toolbar_gui.cpp\n\n### Current State\n- Basic main menu implementation exists from previous work (OM-0MKWHTTDX19VSJUF)\n- Window/widget system functional with SDL2 integration\n- Test windows implemented: Highscore, Date Selector, League Table\n\n### Main GUI Components (main_gui.cpp)\n1. **MainWindow** - Main game window containing:\n   - Viewport widget for game world rendering\n   - Toolbar at top\n   - Status bar at bottom\n   - Handles global hotkeys and window management\n\n2. **Key responsibilities**:\n   - Viewport management and scrolling\n   - Global hotkey handling (F1-F12, etc.)\n   - Window z-order management\n   - Game pause/unpause handling\n\n### Toolbar System (toolbar_gui.cpp - 2584 lines)\n1. **Core Components**:\n   - NWidgetToolbarContainer - Dynamic button layout system\n   - Different toolbar modes: Normal game vs Scenario Editor\n   - Dropdown menu system for each toolbar button\n   - Company-specific toolbar variations\n\n2. **Toolbar Buttons** (GM_NORMAL mode):\n   - Pause, Fast Forward, Options, Save/Load\n   - Map, Town Directory, Subsidies, Stations\n   - Finances, Company, Graphs, League\n   - Industries, Trains, Road Vehicles, Ships, Aircraft\n   - Zoom In/Out, Build Rail/Road/Water/Airport\n   - Forest, Music, News, Help, Switch Toolbar\n\n3. **Scenario Editor Toolbar**:\n   - Different set of tools for map editing\n   - Landscape tools, town placement, industry placement\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n#### Phase 1: Enhance Main Menu (Current Focus)\n1. Wire up existing buttons to proper actions:\n   - Highscore button → open highscore window ✓\n   - New Game → (placeholder for now)\n   - Load Game → (placeholder for now)\n   - Options → open date selector (temporary test) ✓\n   - Multiplayer → open league table (temporary test) ✓\n2. Add missing main menu elements:\n   - OpenTTD logo/branding\n   - Version info display\n   - Background image/animation\n\n#### Phase 2: Basic Toolbar Implementation\n1. Create toolbar.rs module with:\n   - ToolbarWindow struct\n   - Basic button layout (simplified version)\n   - Core buttons: Pause, Save, Load, Options, Exit\n2. Position toolbar at top of main window\n3. Implement dropdown menu widget\n\n#### Phase 3: Viewport Integration\n1. Create viewport widget for game world rendering\n2. Integrate with main window\n3. Add basic scrolling support\n\n#### Phase 4: Extended Toolbar\n1. Add remaining toolbar buttons\n2. Implement all dropdown menus\n3. Add scenario editor toolbar variant\n4. Hotkey support\n\n### Compatibility Considerations\n- Save/load integration will need save format compatibility\n- Network games need synchronized toolbar state\n- Determinism: toolbar actions must be command-based\n\n### Follow-on Tasks Identified\n- Viewport rendering system (separate work item)\n- Save/load dialog implementation\n- Options/settings window\n- Network game browser\n- Command system for game actions","createdAt":"2026-01-27T22:55:14.586Z","id":"OM-C0MKX72HZU002IVVN","references":[],"workItemId":"OM-0MKUZSRB51L0YC08"},"type":"comment"}
